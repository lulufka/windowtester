# Disclaimer

This repository is cloned from the original Google `WindowTester Pro` code base.
This repository focuses on getting Java/Swing UI under test.

# Introduction

`WindowTester Pro` is a UI test generation tool for testing `Swing Java` applications.
`WindowTester Pro` eliminates the need to manually create test cases to test GUIs by automating the
process of GUI testing.
Using `WindowTester Pro`, developers can easily create tests for every GUI they create.

The tests generated by `WindowTester Pro` are standard [JUnit](http://junit.org/) tests thus they
can be run within your IDE, or they can be automated to run using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

# Features

- Write automated UI checks as code in JUnit style
- Check state of any (Swing/AWT) UI elements using assertions
- Apply UI interaction like keystrokes, mouse clicks, and more

# Requirements

- JDK 11
- JUnit 3

# Usage

# Contributing

Please open an issue or create a PR.

**Welcome Contributors**

I am taking care currently on the Swing part of Windowtester.
As I lack knowledge in supporting Eclipse SWT/JFace this part is skipped.
Anyone willing to contribute in SWT/JFace and/or Swing feel free to reach out to me.
