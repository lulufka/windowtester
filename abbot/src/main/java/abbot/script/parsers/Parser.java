 * This interface provides a method for converting a {@link String} into some destination class type.  This interface
 * was designed as an extensible method of converting {@link String}s into arbitrary target classes when parsing
 * scripted arguments to methods.  When a script is run and a method is resolved, the {@link String} arguments are
 * converted to the classes required for the method invocation.  Built-in conversions are provided for {@link
 * abbot.script.ComponentReference}s and all the basic types, including arrays.<p>
