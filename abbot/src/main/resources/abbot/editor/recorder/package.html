<!-- One sentence summary -->
Provide recording support for component-specific user actions.  Recorders
capture a raw event stream and turn it into a
{@link abbot.tester.ComponentTester} action method.  This
group of classes is designed to recognize and capture a distinct semantic
event from basic OS events as they are generated by the system or the user.
For example, the {@link abbot.editor.recorder.AbstractButtonRecorder}
waits for button press, release, and click events in any class derived from
{@link javax.swing.AbstractButton} in the tested GUI, saving them as a "Click"
action (which is provided by the base
{@link abbot.tester.AbstractButtonTester} class). 
<p>
Each unique class of GUI component can have its own recorder class derived
from {@link abbot.editor.recorder.ComponentRecorder}.
This class provides a framework for parsing basic input events into a
conception action on a given component class.  For example,
{@link abbot.editor.recorder.JComboBoxRecorder}
converts a user's combo selection into a script step encapsulating the
{@link abbot.tester.JComboBoxTester#actionSelectIndex(Component,int index)}
method to perform a combo box selection.
<p>
Recorders are used within the script editor by
{@link abbot.editor.recorder.EventRecorder}, but the that class is designed
for use by any framework that wishes to capture and parse events.
