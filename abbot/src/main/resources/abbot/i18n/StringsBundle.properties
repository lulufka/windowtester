# Each entry may be accompanied by a more extensive explanation of what
# information is being provided, to give a better idea of the context in which
# the string is presented.  These comments need not be included in any other
# property file.
#
# All i18n properties files must use ISO 8859-1 character encoding, using
# unicode escapes where required.  If the original source file uses some other
# encoding, name it appropriately (using the encoding name as the extension)
# and add a conversion rule to the build script to convert it to the required
# encoding (native2ascii). 
#
# Property keys should be roughly hierarchical, more to keep them from
# conflicting than anything else.  Older keys don't follow this, but who's
# going to go back and change them all?  Any suggestions of a good tool to do
# so are welcome.
#

# Do not put this key into any translation files! it is used to identify when
# the default properties have been loaded.
abbot.DefaultPropertiesLoaded=yes

#
# Put all translatable properties here.  Don't worry too much about the order.
