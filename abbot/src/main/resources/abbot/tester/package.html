<!-- One sentence summary -->
Provide component-specific actions and tests.  Each unique class of GUI component can have its own Tester class derived from
{@link abbot.tester.ComponentTester}.
This class provides any number of action methods which can exercise the
various user semantic actions that the GUI component supports.  For example,
{@link abbot.tester.AbstractButtonTester}
provides the
{@link abbot.tester.AbstractButtonTester#actionClick(java.awt.Component)}
method to perform a button click.  The Tester may also provide bean-like
is/get methods to facilitate access to component properties that might not
otherwise be readily available as a property.  For example, 
{@link abbot.tester.JPopupMenuTester} 
has a
{@link abbot.tester.JPopupMenuTester#getMenuLabels(java.awt.Component)}
method which returns the text of the menu items within it as an array of
{@link java.lang.String}.

<h3>Keymaps</h3>
Provides maps between keystrokes and resulting typed characters, so that for
any given key character, the keystroke required to produce it may be looked
up.  The maps are properties files where the keys are a combination of
keycodes and modifiers.  In the case of multiple keystrokes mapping to the
same character, a modifier suffix of zero will take precedence over others,
but otherwise you might get any valid keystroke which produces the
character.<p> 
Each property key comprises a keycode represented by the suffix of
{@link java.awt.event.KeyEvent}.VK_</code> constant, a period, and an integer
modifier mask (0/shift, 1/control, 2/meta, or 8/alt).  The value is either the
hex value of the resulting character, or one of {illegal, system, untyped}.
"Illegal" means an IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the value is used,
"system" means that the key caused the key mapping application to lose
keyboard focus, and "untyped" means that no keychar input was produced.<p>
The name/value pairs in the keymap files are sorted to facilitate diffs.  If
keymaps differ for the same locale/OS, then non-producing values should take
precedence over defined values, provided there exists at least one keystroke
in the file for producing the given value.  Only values defined across
<i>all</i> keymaps for a given locale/OS should be used to avoid using any
invalid keystrokes.<p>
<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
There is a keymap generator which generates these maps for the current locale
and OS.  
@see abbot.tester.MapGenerator
